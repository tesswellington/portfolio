# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

Hello! I'm Theresa "Tess" Wellington, a 4th-year Statistics and Data Science student at UCLA with a passion for machine learning, predictive modeling, and using data to drive meaningful change. 
I believe AI and machine learning have the power to transform lives for the better. As this field rapidly expands, I am committed to contributing ethically responsible, innovative, and impactful work that prioritizes real-world benefits.
My projects span predictive healthcare, political science, and consumer behavior analysis, with the goal of uncovering meaningful insights and motivating data-driven solutions that make a real difference. Below, you'll find some of my recent projects in data analysis and machine learning.

## Featured Projects

### Predicting Drug Response in Cancer Patients (Current Project)
- **Goal:** Predict how cancer patients will respond to different treatments based on their genomic profiles
- **Tech Stack:**
- **Repo:**

### Heart Failure Mortality Prediction (Stats 140XP @ UCLA)
- **Goal:** Identify key risk factors in mortality from heart failure using data analysis and machine learning.
- **Tech Stack:** R, tidyverse, ggplot, stepwise regression (AIC), XGBoost, decision trees, LaTeX
- **Repo:** [heart-failure-prediction](https://github.com/tesswellington/heart-failure-prediction)

### Predicting U.S. Presidential Election Results (Stats 101C @ UCLA)
- **Goal:** Build a machine learning model to predict county-level winners in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election (Biden vs. Trump) based on demographic and education data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The dataset includes 3,111 counties, with 75% used for training and 25% for testing.
- **Course Competition Result:** Our team tied for 5th place out of 17 teams in accuracy
- **Tech Stack:** R, tidyverse, ggplot
- **Repo:**

### Predicting Amazon Customer Order Totals (Stats 101C @ UCLA)
- **Goal:** Develop a predictive model to estimate total order value for Amazon customers based on demographic and purchase data. Using a dataset of ~5000 customers from 2018-2022, this project explores customer behavior and purchasing patterns to improve revenue forecasting. 
- **Tech Stack:** R, dplyr, tidyverse, ggplot, random forest, knn, decision tree, boosted tree, glm, stacks
- **Repo:** [amazon-sales-prediction](https://github.com/tesswellington/amazon-sales-prediction)
